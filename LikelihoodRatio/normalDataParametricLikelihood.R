# Function to calculate Likelihood Ratios, for detecting statistical breaks
# in normally distributed independent data
#
# v1.0.2
# Contributors: Andrea Scolari, Arick Grootveld
#
# Inputs: 
#         simMatrix: matrix of data to use for simulations (generally as output 
#                    of indepDataGen script). Each row should be a sequence of 
#                    independently distributed data, such that the first column
#                    contains the first sample of each sequence
#         alpha: the significance level for the estimator
# Outputs:
#         outputVals: array of values containing all the results from the 
#                     simulation
#             - outputVals[1]: the proportion of the detected breaks from
#                              the number of sequences that were input
#             - outputVals[2:-1]: the indexes of the detected breaks. If a value
#                                 is -1, then no break was detected for that 
#                                 sequence
