# Structural-Breaks-in-Time-Series
Research Group

This repository is for our research group to share code with one another while we build up toward the methods we're researching.

- indepDatagen.R is a file for generating independent random samples to test our algorithms against

- normalDataParametricLikelihood.R is the file we can use to predict if breaks happen or not from data generated by indepDatagen.R (only useful if the data is independent and normally distributed)
