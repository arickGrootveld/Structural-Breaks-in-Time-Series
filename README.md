# Structural-Breaks-in-Time-Series
Research Group

This repository is for our research group to share code with one another while we build up toward the methods we're researching.

- indepDatagen.R is a file for generating independent random samples to test our algorithms against

- normalDataParametricLikelihood.R is the file we can use to predict if breaks happen or not from data generated by indepDatagen.R (only useful if the data is independent and normally distributed)

- runNormalIndepDataProcessAndGatherResults.R is the file that pulls the whole parametric likelihood section together. In order to get results from the independent normal data generation process, simply adjust the parameters at the top and run it. It might take a little bit, but once finished it will print out a table of results in the command window.


- SIC & LikelihoodRatio & CUSUM Folders:
Contains the code of the associated algorithm
